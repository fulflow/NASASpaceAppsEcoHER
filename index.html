    <h2 class="section__header"> The Problem. </h2>
    <p class="section__description">
      While climate change and gender may not seem immediately connected, thereâ€™s actually a deep and significant
      relationship between them. The climate crisis disproportionately impacts women and girls, worsening existing
      gender inequalities. Women rely heavily on natural resources but have less access to them, and they often bear the
      main responsibility for securing food, water, and fuel. In low-income countries, they are deeply involved in
      agriculture but face more significant challenges adapting to climate change due to limited access to land, credit,
      and technology. Cultural norms, childcare duties, and poverty further restrict their mobility and opportunities,
      often forcing girls out of school to help at home. Climate-related stress also increases the risk of violence,
      trafficking, and exploitation, leaving women especially vulnerable during crises.

      Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve created this websiteâ€”to spread awareness and advocate for meaningful change.

        <h4>Adapting to Climate Change</h4>
        <p>
          The Governors' Global Climate Summit is turning words into action! Local leaders are stepping up, tackling
          climate change head-on, with bold strategies to protect vulnerable regions and push for global solutions. With
          the Copenhagen talks on the horizon, the pressureâ€™s onâ€”this could be our last chance to make real change!

        <h4>U.S. Strategy on Climate Change and Women</h4>
        <p>
          The U.S. is empowering women in the fight against climate change! A new strategy tackles the unique challenges
          women face, like increased risks of violence and economic hardships, while promoting their leadership in green
          jobs and climate solutions. Women are now at the forefront of building a more sustainable future!

        <h4>Connection between Gender Inequality and Climate Change</h4>
        <p>
          Read about a blog by the UN on how women and girls bear the brunt of climate change's impacts, facing greater
          risks to their health, livelihoods, and safety. As they share their stories and lead solutions, it's time the
          world listens and takes action. Empowering women is key to fighting climate changeâ€”letâ€™s amplify their voices
          and support their leadership!
