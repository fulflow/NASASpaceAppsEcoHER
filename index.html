    <h2 class="section__header"> Climate Change and Gender Inequality Crisis </h2>
    <p class="section__introdescription">
      The climate crisis is intricately linked to gender inequality, particularly in agricultural contexts. Women make
      up nearly 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, yet they often rely on outdated farming
      practices that are ill-suited to todayâ€™s environmental challenges. Many women farmers continue to use traditional
      techniques that have been passed down for generations, which can hinder productivity and sustainability.

      These outdated practices are exacerbated by the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls. In
      low-income countries, women are primarily responsible for securing food, water, and fuel for their families, yet
      they have limited access to land, credit, and modern agricultural technologies. Cultural norms and childcare
      responsibilities further restrict their mobility and opportunities, often forcing young girls out of school to
      assist at home..<br><br>
      Our website serves as a platform to spread awareness and advocate for these essential changes, promoting a
      brighter future for women and their communities. We also suggest innovative solutions to these problems that can help them thrive in the face of climate challenges.

          risks to their health, livelihoods, and safety. As they share their stories and lead solutions, it's time the
          world listens and takes action. Empowering women is key to fighting climate changeâ€”letâ€™s amplify their voices
          and support their leadership!
